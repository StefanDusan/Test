1. Access modifier of the constants needs to be private --> private
2. Constants should be always declared as final --> private final
3. Create a private constructor (to avoid creating object for the class - can be called directly by referencing by name only) --> private static final
4. Constants should be accessed via getters

When creating constants class, private constructor must be created in order to access constants directly without creating objects of the class
As we are creating string constant, name should be all uppercase to easily distinct from standard strings
If string returned by getter is static, getter must be static too
